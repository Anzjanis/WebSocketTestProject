Created project using cucumber archetype

After doing this homework, I am not sure if Java was correct language to be used, but in the end it achieved what was epxected,
    just lot more code/time was needed

Sometimes there is quite slow update feed for subscriptions especially trades. DEV.yaml retry amount can be increased to achieve longer querying period

Project will contain following dependencies:
    * Cucumber: To be able to write test cases BDD style and test cases will be human readable format
    * JUnit: Unit test framework
    * Picocontainer: Used for dependency injection, allows to share test information between classes and keep test context.
        Make tests easier to run in parallel
    * Jackson: Used for serializing/deserializing json files into dto/models
    * Java-WebSocket: Web socket client
