Created project using cucumber archetype

Biggest mistake: using java for this project

Project will contain following dependencies:
    * Cucumber: To be able to write test cases BDD style and test cases will be human readable format
    * JUnit: Unit test framework
    * Picocontainer: Used for dependency injection, allows to share test information between classes and keep test context.
        Make tests easier to run in parallel
    * Jackson: Used for serializing/deserializing json files into dto/models
    * Java-WebSocket: Web socket client
