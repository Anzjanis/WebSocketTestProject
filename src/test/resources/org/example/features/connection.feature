  @Dev
  Scenario Outline: Send ping message with different ID's to check if connection is alive and working as expected
    Given web socket client connection is created
    Then web socket client state should be "OPEN"

    When I send ping request with "<id>" number
    Then I receive pong response

    Examples:
      | id     |
      | random |
      | 13     |
      | empty  |
